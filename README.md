## Getting started

### Requirements

For building:

- a C compiler, preferably GCC

### Installation

Clone this repository locally, `cd` into the newly downloaded directory and run
`make`:

```
git clone https://github.com/xylous/sea.git sea
cd sea
make
```

And voil√†, a binary called `sea` should appear in that directory. You could move
it onto `$PATH` afterwards.

arguments. Running it starts an interactive session. You can press `Enter` or
`Ctrl-D` to exit.
