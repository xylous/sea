# sea

A shell. Seashell. Seash?. Written in C

For a detailed history of the project, check [the Changelog](./Changelog.md)

## Getting started

### Requirements

For building:

- GNU Make
- a C compiler, preferably GCC

### Installation

Clone this repository locally, `cd` into the newly downloaded directory and run
`make`:

```
git clone https://github.com/xylous/sea.git sea
cd sea
make
```

And voil√†, a binary called `sea` should appear in that directory. You could move
it onto `$PATH` afterwards.

### Usage

To run, invoke it on the command line; for the time being, it takes no
arguments. Running it starts an interactive session. You can press `Enter` or
`Ctrl-D` to exit.
